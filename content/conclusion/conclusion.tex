\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:con}
In this paper, we propose to normalize the T2W-\ac{mri} prostate images based on a Rician \textit{a priori}.
An extensive comparison was conducted showing that the Rician normalization outperforms the Gaussian and linear normalization by parts for T2W-\ac{mri} prostate images normalization.
