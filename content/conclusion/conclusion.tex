\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:con}
In this paper, we propose to normalize the T2W-\ac{mri} prostate based on a Rician a priori. 
An extensive comparison between the proposed method and state-of-the-art normalization techniques show that the T2w-\ac{mri} prostate for different patients are better aligned using a Rician distribustion.
