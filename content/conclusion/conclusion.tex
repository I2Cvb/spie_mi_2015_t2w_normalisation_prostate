\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:con}
In this paper, we propose to normalize the T2W-\ac{mri} prostate images using two new strategies: (i) based on a Rician \textit{a priori} and (ii) based on a \ac{srsf} representation which do not make any assumption regarding the \ac{pdf} of the data.
An extensive comparison was conducted showing that the Rician normalization outperforms the Gaussian, \ac{srsf}-based, and piecewise-linear normalization for T2W-\ac{mri} prostate images normalization.
